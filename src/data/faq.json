        "answer": [
            "The number of treatments varies depending on the area being treated, your hair type, and individual hair growth cycles. Most clients need between 8 and 12 sessions for the best results, spaced about 4 to 6 weeks apart. Some areas or hair types may require occasional maintenance treatments.",
            "After completing the full course, we usually recommend one maintenance (touch-up) session per year to keep your skin smooth and prevent new hair growth."

        "question": "How to Prepare for Laser Hair Removal session?",
        "answer": [
            "1. Shave the area one day prior to treatment.",
            "To ensure the most effective and efficient session, please shave the treatment area using your preferred method and shaving products the day before your appointment. This helps prevent irritation and allows the laser to target the hair follicles directly, not surface hair. Arriving already shaved also helps us make the most of your appointment time, so we can focus entirely on the procedure itself.",
            "2. Remove make up before the procedure",
            "If you’ve booked a facial laser hair removal session, please arrive without any makeup on. This ensures your skin is clean and ready for treatment. It's best to remove cosmetics at home using your own skincare products that are compatible with your skin type, helping to avoid any irritation.",
            "3. Avoid Sun Exposure",
            "Do not tan or expose your skin to direct sunlight for at least 2 weeks before the treatment. Use SPF 30+ daily.",
            "4. No waxing, threading, tweezing or use of any chemical depilatories or bleach the area before and while undergoing the laser hair removal sessions.",
            "5. Avoid Using Active Skincare Products and Perfumes",
            "Discontinue retinoids, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and other exfoliating or irritating products 3–5 days before treatment. Also we recommend not to use any perfume, lotion or cologne on the treatment area prior to procedure."
